# Email Regular Expression

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex, are powerful tools in the toolkit of an aspiring web developer. 
They are a specialized sequence of characters that define a search pattern, allowing you to match and manipulate 
strings of text efficiently. Regular expressions find extensive use in tasks such as data validation, form input 
validation, and text manipulation on websites. By mastering regular expressions, you can enhance your ability 
to validate user inputs, extract specific information from text, and ensure data consistency across your web applications. 


## Summary

I will be summarizing an email regex. I will also be explaining its use, characters. and how to apply it in a project. As well as,
other aspects of its code, such as quantifiers and grouping constructs. This is a code snippet of that regular expression. 
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`


Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
